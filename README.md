# Berkeleytime-Server
A server for the clean, totally not pornographic, snapchat story for Berkeley students

Alright, so running this is a bit tricky currently.

First go to this link: https://github.com/martinp/pysnap

Clone that git repository, and make sure you have the python "requests" library installed. Then, go into that folder and run 
"python setup.py install". Just follow the instructions given in that repo.

Then, to run this script, just do "python server.py" and it should work fine. This is built on Python 2.7, so it should work
on newer versions as well.
